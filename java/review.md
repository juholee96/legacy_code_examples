1. Program runs well, but would like to know specifically which player wins "X" or "0" when the game is over
2. During the initGame() could add a greeting message to start the game
3. When the game is a draw, make sure to print a 'DRAW' messsage
4. The intialization of the board seems fine but maybe look into making the board into a 2D array. Would need to rework the code but may be easier to eval draw, printing messages/board, and updating the board.
5. Nice job making concise comments next to code to describe what it is doing
6. Overall:

- Wasn't too hard to follow the code
- the game runs smoothly in the terminal
- I would like more messages to be displayed from the start of the game, the middle (who's turn is it?), and the end (Who won? draw?)
